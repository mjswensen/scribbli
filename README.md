# Scribbli

[Scribbli](https://mjswensen.github.io/scribbli/) is digital scratch paper for developers. Sometimes you need space to reason through a problem or design an algorithm.

Scribbli is hosted via GitHub at [https://mjswensen.github.io/scribbli/](https://mjswensen.github.io/scribbli/), but feel free to download and run Scribbli locally. No setup required -- just open `index.html` in your browser. Notes and drawings are saved in `localStorage`.
