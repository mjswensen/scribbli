# Scribbli

[Scribbli](http://scribb.li/) is digital scratch paper for developers. Sometimes you need space to reason through a problem or design an algorithm.

Scribbli is hosted via GitHub at [http://scribb.li/](http://scribb.li/), but feel free to download and run Scribbli locally. No setup required -- just open `index.html` in your browser. Notes and drawings are saved in `localStorage`.
